<h1>Welcome, and thanks for visiting. I'm Josh.</h1>

<h2>I'm persuing a B.S. in Information Science at the University of Colorado Boulder, and I expect to graduate in May 2020.</h2>
<h2>I'm super interested in data and the information that can be extracted from it. This site is where you can find my portfolio of data exploration and findings.</h2>
